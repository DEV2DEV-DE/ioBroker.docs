# 适用于 KEBA KeContact P20 或 P30 和 BMW i wallbox 的 ioBroker 适配器
使用 UDP 协议控制您的充电站并使用自动调节，例如通过光伏剩余电量和电池存储为您的车辆充电。

＃＃ 安装
通过 ioBroker Admin 安装此适配器：

1. 打开实例配置对话框
2. 输入 KEBA KeContact 墙盒的 IP 地址
3. 输入光伏自动或功率限制的电表状态以及电池存储所需的数据
4.保存配置
5. 启动适配器

＃＃ 配置
### KeContact IP 地址
这是您的 KEBA KeContact 或 BMW i 墙盒的 IP 地址。支持与Keba KeContact S10（相位开关装置）的组合。

### 固件检查
由于 Keba 网站更改，不再支持。

### 被动模式
如果您想自己控制您的墙盒并且不希望此适配器执行某些自动操作，请激活此选项。在这种情况下，所有有关光伏自动和功率限制的后续选项都将被忽略。

### 后续墙盒
如果这是您环境中的后续墙盒，请激活此选项。目前，只能主动管理一个 Wallbox。所有其他实例（单独的实例）必须选中此选项，因为只有一个实例可以接收广播消息。该墙盒/实例将以被动模式运行。

### 加载充电会话
您可以选中此选项以定期从壁箱下载最新的充电会话 (30)。
v1.1.1 及以下版本的用户请注意：您必须选中此选项才能仍然接收充电会话！

＃＃＃ 刷新间隔
这是墙盒应查询新收费值的频率（以秒为单位）。

默认值为 10 分钟，这是 KeConnect 负载和 ioBroker 中最新信息之间的良好平衡。

### PV 自动装置
要根据剩余电量（例如通过光伏）为您的车辆充电，您还可以定义代表剩余电量和主电源的状态。这些值用于计算可用于充电的安培数。通过附加值，您可以定义

* 切换充电相 1p/3p 或使用 Keba Kecontact X2 端口的状态（配合 Keba KeContact S10 或任何其他接触器）
* 电池存储当前电量的状态，因此光伏自动装置将额外使用它为您的车辆充电
* 限制电池存储功率的选项，仅以最小功率进行充电
* 如果您想使用充电站的 X1 输入来控制是满功率充电还是光伏自动充电，请切换 X1 选项
* 与默认 6 A 不同的最小安培数（仅适用于雷诺 Zoe）
* 可用于开始充电的功率值（这意味着即使没有足够的剩余电量也会开始充电 - 建议 0 W 用于 1 相充电，500 W 至 2000 W 用于 3 相充电）
* 安培数增量（建议 500 mA）
* 可以暂时用于维持充电会话的关注值（这意味着即使不再有足够的剩余电量，充电也会稍后停止 - 将添加起始关注 - 建议 500 W）
* 充电会话的最短持续时间（即使剩余电量不再充足，充电会话至少会持续这一次 - 建议 300 秒）
* 每次剩余时间不再足够时继续充电的时间（以弥补阴天的时间）

### 1p/3p 充电
如果您有一个安装接触器来连接（断开）充电站的第 2 相和第 3 相，并且该开关可以由状态触发，则该适配器能够开始用一相充电，并在剩余电量充足的情况下切换到三相充电为了它。
在这种情况下，请输入您的安装接触器的状态以及它是 NO（常开）还是 NC（常闭）

### 电池存储
如果您拥有电池存储，请填写此处的选项。通过指定剩余电量状态和电池存储方面的考虑，该适配器可以控制是否应使用电池存储为您的车辆充电，具体取决于选项中预定义的策略。

### 功率限制
您还可以限制最大。壁箱的功率限制主功率。例如。当运行夜间储存加热器时，您可能必须遵守最大功率限制。
如果您输入一个值，您的 Wallbox 将持续受到限制，不能超过您的功率限制。
最多可以指定电能表的三种状态进行限制。所有值都将相加来计算电流消耗。
额外的复选框用于指定是否包含壁箱功率（在这种情况下，将从状态值中减去壁箱功率）。

### 动态选项
此外，还有一些状态会影响光伏发电自动运行的行为，例如通过您自己的脚本根据您的需要更新这些值）

* kecontact.n.automatic.photovoltaics - 自动激活光伏（true）或设置为 false 时将以最大功率为车辆充电
* kecontact.n.automatic.calcPhases - 定义用于充电计算的当前相数。这是 Keba Deutschland 版本所必需的，可用于所有充电站的初始充电会话
* kecontact.n.automatic.addPower - 定义允许为车辆充电的瓦数（与选项中相同）
* kecontact.n.automatic.pauseWallbox - 只要设置为 true，就会立即停止每个充电会话
* kecontact.n.automatic.limitCurrent - 将充电限制为指定的安培数（以 mA 为单位）（0 = 无限制）
* kecontact.n.automatic.batteryStorageStrategy - 策略是否以及如何使用电池存储为车辆充电
* kecontact.n.automatic.batterySoCForCharging - 通过指定低于该值禁止充电的 SoC 来限制车辆电池存储的使用

示例：要以 6A 的恒定安培数为车辆充电（无论剩余电流有多少），请将光伏设置为 false，并将电流限制为 6000。

      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
